            Hi, I'm <strong>Janice</strong>! I've worked within the travel industry for 12 plus years. I've always been interested in the technical aspects of my role and how the reservation systems I use work. I've seen the industry change throughout the years and adapted through the changes. This is what has interested me into delve into web development. As I want to be able to development my skills, to be able to help build travel applications to one day help build applications that are more user focused.
